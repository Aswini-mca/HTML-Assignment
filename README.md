# HTML Pages Project

This project contains two HTML pages developed as a mandatory assignment. Each HTML page represents a separate screen and is styled using a single CSS file. The guidelines provided for the development of these pages have been strictly adhered to.

## Pages

### Page 1
- **File Name:** `index.html`
- **Description:** This HTML file represents the page_01 of the application. It includes a chart (styled using CSS) and svg icons used.

### Page 2
- **File Name:** `page_02.html`
- **Description:** This HTML file represents the page_02 of the application. Similar to page_01.

## CSS File
- **File Name:** `styles.css`
- **Description:** This CSS file contains the styles for both screens. It includes styling for the charts and any additional elements present on the screens.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` and `page_02.html` in a web browser to view the screens.
